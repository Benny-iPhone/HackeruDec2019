# Process - Application
Different Application in background = Different Process

# Thread - functionality Flow,
Process has Threads.

Threads are limited. Depending on Operation System.

# Main Thread - A Designated Thread for UI Operation

Other Thread

Networking thread
Database thread
Logging Thread

Short Async operation.

# Operation Queue
GCD - Grand Central Dispatch

2 types of operation Queue
- Serial (one by one) => Only 1 Thread can execute operations at a given time
For Main Queue => Only Main Thread executes its operation
- Concurrent (parallel) => More than 1 Queue can execute its operations

=====
Sharing is Caring
=====

Processes - Share hard drive files. OS stuff (clipboard)
Thread - hard drive files, OS stuff, heap memory

func doSomething() {
  var num = 3 //stack
}

if 2 threads invoke 'doSomething()' each one own Different 'num'.

class DBManager {
  static let manager = DBManager()

  var dbVersion : String = "1.0"
}

DBManager instance, and its properties, are in the heap, both thread can read and write.

One more Example:
a long init Process, can occur more than once when using multiple threads.
